What is this?:
This is a Universal Windows Platform project (UWP) written in C#. 
This project is developed as the last assignment in the course C# at Syddansk Universitet.

(To get started, skip the intro)

Introduction:
This project is a draw app. 
A user can enter a draw using the app. One entry takes:
  - First name
  - Sur name
  - E-mail
  - Phone numer
  - Date of birth
  - And a serial number 
An entry into the draw is uniqe, meaning you can not enter the draw twice using the same E-mail, Phone number, or serial number. 
The serial number is used for deciding if the user won or lost. Only 100 valid serial numbers exist.
  These Serial numbers will be generated at random by the application first time it is opened.
  The valid serial numbers can be found in the persisted file, after first run of the application (se below)
The application lets a user with the password and username see the 10 latest serial number submissions.
  And what else should be in the username,than the one and only: Jon skeet
  With the password: 991906 (Jon skeets stackoverflow reputation)

This project consist of 3 solutions. One UWP solution, one Library, and one unit test. 
  The library solution: EnterDrawAppLib
  Contains methods for persisting objects to a file location.
  The library file is called "DataPersistence.cs"

  The Application: EnterDrawApp
  Contains the main methods for:
    - Handeling button events
    - Displaying text
    - Validating data
    - Exceptions
    - Data containers
  The Application methods are covered in the following files: 
    MainPage.xaml.cs - Initialization method
    EventMethods.cs - Handles application events, such as application suspension, and buton clicks
    ValidationMethods.cs - Handles validation of data, and checks for dublicate entry
    PublicMethods.cs - Getter and setter methods for the xaml tekst boxes. Mostly used by the Unit test.
    DataValidationExceptions.cs - defines the costume exceptions for the application
    Folder "DataStructures" -> EntryData.cs - Contains the class that implements the current list of entries
    Folder "DataStructures" -> SerailNumbers.cs - This class can hold, validate, and generate serial numbers
      
  The unit test: EnterDrawApp.Tests
  This solution contains the unit tests for the application. 
  It test for data validation, and file persistence.
  The file is called "UnitTest.cs"

Steps to run the project: 
  Setup:
  1) goto solution explorer
  2) Deploy the "EnterDrawApp" (right click - > Deploy)
  3) Deploy the "EnterDrawApp.Tests" (right click - > Deploy)

  To run the application:
  1) right click "EnterDrawApp" -> Debug -> Start new instance

  To run the Unit test: 
  1) Test -> Windows -> Test explorer
  2) click "Run All"
  
  To enter a draw: 
    Enter your information, and guess on a serial number (Hint they are all integers between 1000 and 100000), press "Done".
    If anything in the entered infromation was wrong, the app will tell you, and you can correct it and press "Done" again.
    If you get tires of guessing on Serial numbers, there are 2 test serial numbers: 
      - "#UnitTestSerialNumber#" 
      - "#UnitTestSerialNumber1#"
    Remeber that each serial number is unique, so it can only be used once. 
    If you want to see all posible serial numbers, this is my path(no garanti it works for you..):
    AppData\Local\Packages\5ec0059e-99e0-4e01-a18e-ba7b5592dff6_pth98vj66mbec\LocalState\ValidSerialNumbers

  It is posible to login and see the past 10 entered serial numbers, the username and password goes as follow:
  Username: Jon skeet
  Password(Jon skeet's stackoverflow rep): 991906
